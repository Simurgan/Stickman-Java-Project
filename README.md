 CmpE150 Introduction to Computing course project homework 2019 fall semester Bogazici University Computer Engineering Department.
 There was a challenge about reducing the number of characters used in source code except comment lines. The methods in the class were written for this purpose.
 Also you can check the homework description file and see the test cases.
 You can execute the program with two integer parameters, first for stickman height and second for stair height.
 Just be sure that stair height is greater than or equal to zero and stickman haight is greater than stair height + 2.
